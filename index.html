    <h1>Find Cities By Consonants</h1>
    <p>Hatched from a radio quiz question: Can you think of a US state which has the same kind and number of consonants as one of its cities? For example, Georgia would need a city name containing exactly 2 g's and one r.</p>
    <p>When you have your guess, open the console and type in <span>findAMatch("stateName", stateName);</span> in camelCase if the state name is more than one word long (lowercase if only one word). The first parameter is a string of the state name and the second represents the array of cities. <br><br>For example: <span>findAMatch("newHampshire", newHampshire);</span> </p>
    <p>There are only 4 states that qualify. See if you can find all 4!</p>
