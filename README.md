# citiesByConsonant
Finding cities whose consonants are equal to the consonants in their state.

A simple website hatched from a radio quiz question. Can you think of a US state which has the same kind and number of consonants as one of its cities? For example, Georgia would need a city name containing exactly 2 g's and one r. To find out if a state contains a city with the same consonants as the state name (by letter and amount), open the console and run: findAMatch("stateName", stateName); in camelCase if more than one word long. The first parameter is a string of the state name and the second represents the array of cities. For example: findAMatch("newHampshire", newHampshire); There are only 5 states that qualify. See if you can find all 5!
