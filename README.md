# citiesByConsonant
Finding cities whose consonants are equal to the consonants in their state.

A simple website hatched from a radio quiz question. Can you think of a US state which has the same kind and number of consonants as one of its cities? For example, Georgia would need a city name containing exactly 2 g's and one r. There are only 5 states that qualify. See if you can find all 5!
